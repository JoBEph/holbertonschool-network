# **What Happens When You Type** `https://www.google.com` **and Press Enter?**

Have you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes when you visit a website? While it may seem like a simple process, your request actually triggers a series of crucial network operations. In this article, we'll walk through each key step involved in loading a webpage.

## **DNS Request**

Before your browser can fetch a website, it needs to determine the IP address associated with the domain name. This is where the Domain Name System (DNS) comes into play. Your browser first checks its local cache and, if the IP isn't found, sends a DNS request to a recursive resolver. The resolver queries authoritative servers until it retrieves the correct IP address for `www.google.com`.

## **Establishing a TCP/IP Connection**

Once the IP address is obtained, your browser initiates a connection using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) over the Internet Protocol (IP). TCP ensures reliable data transmission by establishing a three-way handshake between your device and the Google server. This process synchronizes both ends for seamless communication.

## **Firewall Inspection**

Firewalls, located both on your device and at various points across Google's infrastructure, inspect packets to block malicious traffic. If the request passes security checks, it's forwarded further into Google's network.

## **Secure Communication via HTTPS/SSL**

Since `https://` is used, SSL/TLS encryption secures the communication. A TLS handshake takes place to authenticate the Google server and exchange encryption keys. This ensures your data remains private and protected from interception.

## **Load Balancer Distribution**

To handle millions of users simultaneously, Google employs load balancers that distribute incoming requests across multiple servers. This prevents overload and optimizes response times.

## **Web Server Processing**

Once routed to a specific web server, the request is processed. The server identifies the required files—HTML, CSS, JavaScript—and prepares them for transmission.

## **Application Server Execution**

For dynamic requests, the web server interacts with application servers that run backend logic. These servers execute necessary functions and fetch relevant data.

## **Database Query**

If your request involves stored information, an application server retrieves data from Google's databases.

## **Response Rendering**

The web server assembles the final response, compresses files, and sends them back to your browser. Your browser then parses the HTML, applies CSS styling, and executes JavaScript to render the page.
